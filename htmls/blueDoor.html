    <p> It’s the janitor’s closet. You find a plunger and go back to the bathroom to do what you gotta do. You manage to clean up the mess and leave the bathroom high from the fumes. Your boss comes to you and tells you you have another job: an actor has a serious case of mongrel toenails and needs them clipped for a scene. This is the last straw. A combination of you being high and being fed up leads you to tell your boss you’re quitting.
