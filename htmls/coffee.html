    <p>You walk down the street to the local coffee shop. You walk up to the register and order whatever is on the list. The worker tells you that they no longer sell the sage infused caramel macchiato. Shit, thatâ€™s what 4 different people had ordered! You order the lavender infused caramel macchiato instead, hoping no one will notice the difference. You walk back to the studio and manage to spill only half of the drinks.</p>
