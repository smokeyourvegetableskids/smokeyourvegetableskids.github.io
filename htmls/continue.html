    <p>You sit defeated on the pavement until you hear someone next to you. “Put it in rice,” A stranger says to you. You look up and they offer you a handful of loose rice. You graciously take it and patch your cut with the rice and instantly feel better. You make your way back to the electric scooter and ride it to the studio. You finally make it to A24.
