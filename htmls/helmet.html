    <p>You quickly run back inside to grab your safety gear. You walk out and secure your helmet on your head and your knee pads. You swerve traffic and wheelie/manual your way down the road. From the corner of your eye you notice a fellow electric scooter-er. You know by the glint in their eyes that they want a scooter-off. You 360 nose pivot and tail whip your heart out until your wheel catches on a pebble, flying off your electric scooter and tumbling head first into a manhole. </p>
        <p> Thankfully, you manage to escape with your life. Something warm trickles down your leg. No, you didn't piss yourself this time (thanks to the helmet and knee pads) but you've sustained a nasty gash on the side of your leg.</p>
