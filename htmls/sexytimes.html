    <p>Method acting Christian Bale tells you before you guys can go through with this, you have to see something. You agree and walk with him into a back room of the coffee shop that then leads to another room that then leads to another room that then leads to a hallway that leads to another room that leads to an underground basement. You walk down the steps and swat your hand at the fog covering the room. You eyes adjust and you gasp at the sight in front of you. There you see Leonardo Dicaprio (with his oscar in hand), Meryl Streep, Macaulay Culkin from when he was in My Girl, and Millie Bobbie Brown . “We’ve been expecting you,” they say.</p>
