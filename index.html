    <p> Congrats! It took you four years to get a slip of paper! You’ve applied for various internships at film studios hoping to gain more experience. You managed to score an unpaid internship at A24. Now’s your chance to manipulate Timothee Chalamet into falling in love with you. A24 begged to have you after you sent in a portfolio of your sick yo-yo tricks and slime review videos, so you aren’t really that surprised you were the one unpaid intern they hired. You look in front of your closet, but you can’t decide what to wear on your first day.  </p>
